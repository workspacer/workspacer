# workspacer

### a tiling window manager for Windows

workspacer is a tiling window manager for Windows 10, that is similar in style and function to xmonad.

currently, workspacer supports most default xmonad functionality, like custom layout engines, workspace support, and powerful keybinds.

# installation

[check out the quickstart guide](/quickstart), workspacer will automatically check for updates!

# configuration

workspacer is entirely configured in actual C# (which means that you can literally configure it however you want!). a full tutorial on how to configure workspacer is coming soon!

## a note on configuration compatibility

because workspacer is a new project, I have not fully nailed down how I want the interfaces to look or behave, so everything in workspacer is subject to change. if you write a configuration file, be warned that I may make large changes that break backwards compatibility. i will announce when the configuration API is going to be stable. however, if your config breaks, feel free to let me know and I will be glad to help you modify it to work with a newer version.

# is this ready for use yet?

kinda! see the [installation](#installation). there are likely some major bugs in workspacer that I have not fixed yet, but it is more or less functionally complete. i am using workspacer 24/7 at home and at work at the moment, so it suites my needs (aside from the occasional hickup or crash). if you run into any problems, please open an issue!
