# Installing

Download the installer or the zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/workspacer/workspacer/releases/latest) page and install/unzip it anywhere you like. 

Alternatively, workspacer is available via [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/workspacer):

```
choco install workspacer
```

and via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install workspacer
```

Workspacer automatically checks for updates. However, if you are using a package manager (either Chocolatey or Scoop), you should uncomment/add this line in your workspacer configuration file to disable autoupdates:

```cs
context.Branch = Branch.None;
```

# Configuring

Workspacer loads a default configuration with almost everything you'd need, but you will likely want to modify things like [key bindings](#how-do-i-register-custom-keybindings), [widgets](#menu-bar-widgets) on the bar, [workspaces](#how-do-i-define-custom-workspaces), [layouts](#layout-engines), [plugins](#plugins) or otherwise the default behavior of workspacer.

A configuration file can be generated by right clicking the ```workspacer``` system tray icon, and selecting the option to create an example configuration in:

```
C:\Users\<username>\.workspacer\workspacer.config.csx
```

Workspacer is configured in the C# language, using types and interfaces provided by workspacer itself. This means that while workspacer requires knowledge of programming to use, it's configuration is extremely powerful, and allows you to modify, or even replace, most functionality that drives workspacer. For example, a common use case is to implement a custom layout engine (just define a class that satisfies the interface `ILayoutEngine`) entirely inside the config file, and then use it to define the desired custom layout behavior, without needing to modify workspacer itself.

Workspacer's configuration file allows for __type checking__ and __intellisense__! currently, only VSCode with the C# extension is supported. Opening the `.workspacer` folder in your home directory inside VSCode with the C# extension installed will provide syntax highlighting, type checking, and autocompletion automatically because of the [`#r` directives at the top of the config file](https://github.com/workspacer/workspacer/blob/master/src/workspacer/Config/workspacer.config.template.csx) (so don't remove those, or else this won't work!).

[The config page](/config) lists a few examples and tips & tricks on how to customize workspacer to your liking.

# Learning

Workspacer's default configuration makes it behave like other tiling window managers, but deviates where not possible due to limitations of the [`Win32` API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) that prevents from freely controlling windows in the same way as an X11 tiling window manager.

[The keybindings page](/keybindings) shows the default set of keybindings.
